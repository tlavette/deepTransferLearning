**Introduction** <br>

Deep Transfer Learning in data science refers to the process of applying knowledge gained from one domain or task to improve performance on a different, but related, domain or task. This is particularly useful when there is a lack of labeled data in the target domain, allowing models to leverage learned representations from a larger, labeled dataset in a similar source domain. In this example, it is the applied method used for diagnosis of cancer through evaluating data from MRIs, CT scans and other medical images.  This paper discusses the differences and the advantages of using Deep Transfer Learning in these cases.
